      title: ICON nextGEMS Cycle 4 simulation
      summary: |
        Coupled atmosphere-ocean simulation at 5km resolution in the ocean and 10km in the atmosphere. Run for 30 years starting in 2020.
    
        [**Resolutions**](https://swift.dkrz.de/v1/dkrz_b381d76e-63d7-4aeb-96f0-dfd91e102d40/nextgems_prefinal/nextgems_prefinal_output.html)
          * Ocean data is available at healpix levels 0-10
          * Atmosphere data at levels 0-9. 
          * PT15M contains selected 2D fields, 
          * PT3H adds atmospheric 3D fields and more 2D fields of atmosphere and ocean
          * P1D adds ocean 3D fields.

        **Processing**
          * Fields were remapped to HEALPix level 10 using nearest-neighbor interpolation. 
          * Lower levels were generated from this using conservative aggregation.

      title: ICON 2.5 km simulation
      summary: |
        Atmosphere-only simulation at 2.5 km resolution. Run for 1 year and 2 months starting in 2020. 
        **Processing**
          * 2D field time means are calculated from the timestep level values. 
          * 3D data is generated on pressure levels as instantaneous values (mostly starting at 6-hourly (PT6H)). Time means are calculated from the instantaneous values. 
          * Fields were remapped to Healpix level 12 using nearest-neighbor interpolation. Lower levels were generated from this using conservative aggregation. 
          * Level 12 data was (mostly) deleted due to space constraints.
