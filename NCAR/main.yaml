         Atmosphere-land-ocean coupled simulations for 2D fields at 15km grid spacing at 58 atmospheric levels. Run from 2020-03-01 to 2021-03-01.

         **Resolutions**
           * All data is available at HEALPix levels 1-9 for 2D fields

         **Processing**
           * Fields were remapped to HEALPix level 9 using Delaunay triangulation. 
           * Lower levels were generated from this using coarse-graining.
