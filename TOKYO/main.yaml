      title: NICAM 3.5 km simulation
      summary: |
      	Atmosphere-only simulation at 3.5 km resolution. One-year data from 10-year simulations starting in 2011.

	**Simulation**
	  * Horizontal grid: Glevel-11, 41,943,042 control volumes (hexagon/pentagon), average interaval (dx) ~ 3.5 km
	  * Vertical grid: 78 full levels with the model top of about 50 km
	  * Initial conditions: From ERA-Interim for date 2011-01-01T00:00:00Z
	  * External data:
	    * SST and SIC predicted by a slab-ocean model (mixed layer depth 15m), nudged to daily mean fields from OSTIA with a 7-day relaxation time
	    * Greenhouse gases as daily values, following HighResMIP protocol
	    * O3 prescribed from monthly fields, following HighResMIP protocol
	    * Greenhouse gases and O3 With SSP585 scenario after 2015, following HighResMIP protocol

	**Processing**
	  * Fields were remapped from the 3.5 km NICAM to the Healpix grid with conservative remapping.
	  * 2d1h fields have instantaneous values except for precipitation (pr).
	  * 2d3h fields have mean values calculated from each simulation timestep values.
	  * 3d6h fields are generated on 25 pressure levels as instantaneous values starting at 6-hourly interval.
